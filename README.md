# üïµÔ∏è Monitoring Suspicious Discussions (MSD)

Welcome to Monitoring Suspicious Discussions!
This project is designed to monitor and flag potentially suspicious conversations in online forums using natural language processing.

## ü§î What is MSD?

**Monitoring Suspicious Discussions** is a smart forum surveillance tool built for detecting shady or harmful discussions.

Minimizes manual moderation ‚Äî this project automates the process by:

* Scanning text posts.
* Identifying violent/threatening/abusive language.
* Storing and flagging them for admin review only when the context may change the sensitivity of the post.

It‚Äôs powered by **Flask**, **Jinja2**, and **MySQL**. Clean, fast, and effective.

## üìÇ Setting Up MSD on Your System

1. Clone or download this repo.

2. Inside the main folder, make sure you have:

   * `templates/` (for Jinja2 HTML templates)
   * `app.py` (Flask server)
   * `msd.sql` (database schema)
   * `suspicious_model/` (optional logic/ML models)

3. In MySQL:

   * Create a database named `msd`
   * Import `msd.sql` to create necessary tables like `users`, `posts`, and `admins` and make sure to add some data to these tables, either by registering and creating posts (Recommended) or by manually giving them
